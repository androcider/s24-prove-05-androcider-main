**Question 1:**  From Part 1, how did you answer the interview question for the Set Operations problem (should be no more than 30 seconds if spoken aloud)?

I would for the intersection function look at both sets and iterate through them and compare one set to the other
to see if the numbers match and if they do I would add them to a new set. For the union set I would iterate both sets
and find look for the numbers add them to the set and then add the numbers of the 2 sets to the new set of 
numbers. 
**Question 2:**  From Part 2, how did you answer the interview question for the Find Pairs problem (should be no more than 30 seconds if spoken aloud)?

i would iterate through each 2 letter word in the set and see if another word has the same 2 letters by after a word has been seen reversing the rest of the words.
